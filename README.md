It's not a fish, it's a fiiiiiiiiiiishAMBIGUATOR!!!!

Static assets are served from the fishambiguator-static directory. I'm doing this so you don't have to burden Node with serving static stuff. Stick this on another server, or apache on the same server.

Using Mocha for unit tests.

use

```
mocha test/(test file name)
```
to run an individual set of tests.


## Setup

Install PostgreSQL on the host machine, run create-db.sh to create the appropriate database.

Start the Docker containers!
