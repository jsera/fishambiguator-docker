It's not a fish, it's a fiiiiiiiiiiishAMBIGUATOR!!!!

Static assets are served from the fishambiguator-static directory. I'm doing this so you don't have to burden Node with serving static stuff. Stick this on another server, or apache on the same server.

Using Mocha for unit tests.

use

```
mocha test/(test file name)
```
to run an individual set of tests.
